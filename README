Dewey's Pizza is my favorite pizza place. They have special seasonal items that change every month or two.
This little application will monitor Dewey's website and send out a notification when the seasonal items change.


Task List

1. Scrape Dewey's website (python, scrapy?)
2. Notify user (twitter?)
3. Possible improvements?
